## Plug your SMTP server to Minimail

Minimail can work with AWS SES, Mailgun, Postmark, Sendgrid or any other email sending service. The only requisite is to have them provide you with an SMTP server. Once with your SMTP server credentials in hand, here are the steps to make it work with Minimail:

1. Install [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) locally on your server
2. Configure Postfix as a relay to your SMTP server.

**Example setting up Postfix as an SMTP relay with AWS SES:**


```conf
relayhost = [email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_tls_note_starttls_offer = yes
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

Notes:
* Here we are using `email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` as the SMTP server URL, but yours might be different.
* Don't use the port 25 to connect to your SMTP from an AWS EC2 instance. There is a throttling in place on EC2 instance on port 25.
* For a complete guide, see [AWS official documentation on [Integrating Amazon SES with Postfix](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/postfix.html)
* The advantage of using SMTP over an HTTP based API is delegating the sending queue to mature and stable software (Postfix in this case) to handle bounces due to sending quota and ratio. SMTP has more round trips per email to send than an HTTP API, but the first SMTP server being on localhost this overhead is insignificant. Using SMTP also makes Minimail email backend agnostic as the SMTP protocol play the role of a [facade pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern).

## Setup dev env

1. `virtualenv --python=python3.5 . && source bin/activate`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `./manage.py makemigrations && ./manage.py migrate`
4. `./manage.py runserver`

## Setup prod env

1. `export MINIMAIL_ENV=prod`
2. `virtualenv --python=python3.5 . && source bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. `./manage.py makemigrations && ./manage.py migrate`
5. Start the app with gunicorn: `./server_conf/start_stop_django_app.sh`
6. Link the app nginx configuration file to nginx default conf folder: `sudo ln -s /path/to/repo/server_conf/minimail.nginx.conf /path/to/nginx/main/conf/minimail.nginx.conf`
7. Test and reload nginx: `sudo nginx -t && nginx -s reload`

## systemd

1. create the service description in `/etc/systemd/system/minimail.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=app
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
Group=root
WorkingDirectory=<your app directory>/minimail
ExecStart=<your app directory>/minimail/server_conf/start.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

2. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
3. `sudo systemctl start minimail`
4. `sudo systemctl enable minimail` to launch minimail on startup

## Code syntax

### Python

Check for code syntax with `pylint -r no -f colorized minimail`. Add this command in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to auto-check as you commit.

## Frontend framework

We use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=8c2854b0c5b8e7607cea7f997c40c761), customized with system fonts.
